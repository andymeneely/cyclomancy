A humble suggestion on stress

How the characters react always feels a bit random, and I wish I had a chance to mitigate it. As it is now, when I hover over stress I see words like "Tense" and "Irritable". What if those words were more specific that would indicate what they were about to do? That would change my choices, enriching my decision-making.

Exmaple: I see Dismas is "Insecure" at stress level 9. Barristan is about to get a kill shot, but I've learned that when someone is insecure they will wish they got a kill shot. So I have Barristan do something else and let Dismas kill them off, and he loses 1 stress as a result.

Another example: I see Dismas is "Doubtful" and the Plague Doctor is about to heal someone. When I choose someone else, Dismas gets jealous and is upset I didn't heal him saying "I KNEW you wouldn't heal me!"

So that word you see when you hover over the stress bar would be more meaningful, subtle, and makes my decisions more meaningful. Does this mean that you'd have to figure out some of your randomness ahead of time? Sure. But giving me a heads-up would make me consider moves that I wouldn't ordinarily consider given the context.

PS - I'm a HUGE fan and I've played every version of DD since the early days of DD1. Learned a lot about game design from following every changelog. Keep up the good work!
